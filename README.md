# algorithms
A place to hold various algorithms

The idea with this repo is to store some of the algorithms I do and place them in groupings based on topic.

Examples of groupings may be that anything dealing with a matrix will be grouped together and will, itself, be a subgroup of arrays.
Recursive problems will include some dynamic programming solutions (including tabulation solutions which are not recursive by nature).
